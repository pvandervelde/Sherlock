        The following ItemGroup defines which steps are taken during the deploy process. The order of the items in the item group
        determines in which order the deploy steps are executed.

        The following default steps are always executed:
        - Restoring the NuGet packages as specified in the '$(DirWorkspace)\packages.config' file. Additionally also restores the
          NuGet packages as specified in the nBuildKit specific 'packages.config' files.

        The following deploy steps are by default provided through the given properties:
        $(DeployStepsTagVcs)              - Tags the current commit with the version number. Currentlyl supported version control systems are TFS and GIT.
        $(DeployStepsPushToNuget)         - Pushes one or more artifacts to a NuGet feed
        $(DeployStepsPushToDirectory)     - Pushes one or more artifacts to a directory
        $(DeployStepsPushToSymbolServer)  - Pushes one or more NuGet symbol packages to a local symbol server on a UNC path
        $(DeployStepsPushToGitHubRelease) - Pushes zero or more files to a GitHub release

        Additional deploy steps can be defined by providing the path to the MsBuild script that should be executed
        for that step, e.g. adding a deploy step that points to the 'c:\stuff\MyCoolScript.msbuild' will execute
        that script.

        Each script has the following properties passed to it:
        $(SharedPropertyFile)              - The full path to the settings.props file (i.e. this file).
        $(ShouldDisplayDebugLog)          - A flag indicating whether or not to display debug log information, usually at the start of the script execution.
        $(NBuildKitVersion)               - The full version of the nBuildKit library that is executing the build.
        $(DirNBuildKitMsBuild)            - The full path to the directory that contains the nBuildKit scripts.
        $(DirNBuildKitMsBuildShared)      - The full path to the directory that contains the shared nBuildkit scripts.
        $(DirNBuildKitMsBuildExtensions)  - The full path to the directory that contains the nBuildKit extension scripts.
        $(DirNBuildKitMsBuildTemplates)   - The full path to the directory that contains the nBuildKit templates.
