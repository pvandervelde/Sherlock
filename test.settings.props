        The following ItemGroup defines which steps are taken during the test process. The order of the items in the item group
        determines in which order the test steps are executed.

        The following default steps are always executed:
        - Clearing the existing build artifacts from the workspace and creation of the required directories. Clearing the
          existing build artifacts is only executed if the $(ShouldClean) property is set to 'true'.
        - Restoring the NuGet packages as specified in the '$(DirWorkspace)\packages.config' file. Additionally also restores the
          NuGet packages as specified in the nBuildKit specific 'packages.config' files.

        The following test steps are by default provided through the given properties:
        $(TestStepsPrepareGetVersion)    - Gathers version information and stores it in a temporary file for use by the rest of the test process.
                                           Currently supported methods of gathering version information are using (in order):
                                           - The version defined by a custom MsBuild task which is defined in a file of which the path is stored
                                             in the 'VersionScriptPath' property. The task should output:
                                             - VersionMajor
                                             - VersionMinor
                                             - VersionPatch
                                             - VersionBuild
                                             - VersionPreRelease
                                             - VersionSemantic
                                             - VersionSemanticFull
                                             - VersionSemanticNuget
                                           - The version stored in an 'version.xml' file which contains an MsBuild property group with
                                             the properties:
                                             - BuildNumber
                                             - VersionMajor
                                             - VersionMinor
                                             - VersionPatch
                                             - VersionBuild
                                             - VersionPreRelease
                                             - The GitVersion tool (https://github.com/ParticularLabs/GitVersion)
                                             - The GitHubFlowVersion tool (https://github.com/JakeGinnivan/GitHubFlowVersion)
        $(TestStepsPrepareReleaseNotes)  - Gathers the release notes and stores them for later use during the test process. Release notes
                                           are retrieved with the GitReleaseNotes tool (https://github.com/GitTools/GitReleaseNotes) which
                                           currently allows gathering release notes from GitHub, Jira and YouTrack
        $(TestStepsPrepareVcsInfo)       - Stores the Version Control System (VCS) information in a file for later use.
                                           Currently supported version control systems is GIT
        $(TestStepsPrepareGenerateFiles) - Generates one or more files from a set of template files.

        Additional test steps can be defined by providing the path to the MsBuild script that should be executed
        for that step, e.g. adding a test step that points to the 'c:\stuff\MyCoolScript.msbuild' will execute
        that script.

        Each script has the following properties passed to it:
        $(SharedPropertyFile)              - The full path to the settings.props file (i.e. this file).
        $(ShouldDisplayDebugLog)          - A flag indicating whether or not to display debug log information, usually at the start of the script execution.
        $(NBuildKitVersion)               - The full version of the nBuildKit library that is executing the build.
        $(DirNBuildKitMsBuild)            - The full path to the directory that contains the nBuildKit scripts.
        $(DirNBuildKitMsBuildShared)      - The full path to the directory that contains the shared nBuildkit scripts.
        $(DirNBuildKitMsBuildExtensions)  - The full path to the directory that contains the nBuildKit extension scripts.
        $(DirNBuildKitMsBuildTemplates)   - The full path to the directory that contains the nBuildKit templates.
